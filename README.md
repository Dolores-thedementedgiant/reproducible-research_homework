# Reproducible research: version control and R

# Q4.

-- A script for simulating a random_walk is provided in the question-4-code folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe? (10 points)

Even if two random walks both start from the same position which is the origin (0,0), they can end up in very different positions after the same number of steps just out of randomness.
These simulations lack reproducibility: Different results are generated each time when the code is re-executed.
Positions tend to disperse in the available space during random walks.
The next step in a random walk does not depend on the past step, it only depends on the current position.


-- Investigate the term random seeds. What is a random seed and how does it work? (5 points)

Random seed is a value input given to the pseudorandom number generator algorithm at the start of simulation that initializes the random walk. The algorithm then produces a sequence of numbers that are seemingly random but are actually based on the initial random seed value. The same random seed gives rise to identical simulations if number of steps remains constant. By setting random seeds, random walk simulations can be reproduced because the algorithm will produce the same sequence of numbers each time the code is executed. This can be useful when random walks are applied to reproducible simulations such as Brownian motion.

## Instructions

The homework for this Computer skills practical is divided into 5 questions for a total of 100 points (plus an optional bonus question worth 10 extra points). First, fork this repo and make sure your fork is made **Public** for marking. Answers should be added to the # INSERT ANSWERS HERE # section above in the **README.md** file of your forked repository.

Questions 1, 2 and 3 should be answered in the **README.md** file of the `logistic_growth` repo that you forked during the practical. To answer those questions here, simply include a link to your logistic_growth repo.

**Submission**: Please submit a single **PDF** file with your candidate number (and no other identifying information), and a link to your fork of the `reproducible-research_homework` repo with the completed answers. All answers should be on the `main` branch.

## Assignment questions 

1) (**10 points**) Annotate the **README.md** file in your `logistic_growth` repo with more detailed information about the analysis. Add a section on the results and include the estimates for $N_0$, $r$ and $K$ (mention which *.csv file you used).
   
2) (**10 points**) Use your estimates of $N_0$ and $r$ to calculate the population size at $t$ = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth? 

3) (**20 points**) Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the **README.md** file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
   
4) (**30 points**) Sometimes we are interested in modelling a process that involves randomness. A good example is Brownian motion. We will explore how to simulate a random process in a way that it is reproducible:

   - A script for simulating a random_walk is provided in the `question-4-code` folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe? (10 points)
   - Investigate the term **random seeds**. What is a random seed and how does it work? (5 points)
   - Edit the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. Commit the file and push it to your forked `reproducible-research_homework` repo. (10 points)
   - Go to your commit history and click on the latest commit. Show the edit you made to the code in the comparison view (add this image to the **README.md** of the fork). (5 points)

5) (**30 points**) In 2014, Cui, Schlub and Holmes published an article in the *Journal of Virology* (doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00362-14) showing that the size of viral particles, more specifically their volume, could be predicted from their genome size (length). They found that this relationship can be modelled using an allometric equation of the form **$`V = \beta L^{\alpha}`$**, where $`V`$ is the virion volume in nm<sup>3</sup> and $`L`$ is the genome length in nucleotides.

   - Import the data for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses taken from the Supplementary Materials of the original paper into Posit Cloud (the csv file is in the `question-5-data` folder). How many rows and columns does the table have? (3 points)
   - What transformation can you use to fit a linear model to the data? Apply the transformation. (3 points)
   - Find the exponent ($\alpha$) and scaling factor ($\beta$) of the allometric law for dsDNA viruses and write the p-values from the model you obtained, are they statistically significant? Compare the values you found to those shown in **Table 2** of the paper, did you find the same values? (10 points)
   - Write the code to reproduce the figure shown below. (10 points)

  - What is the estimated volume of a 300 kb dsDNA virus? (4 points)

**Bonus** (**10 points**) Explain the difference between reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. How can git and GitHub be used to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of your work? what limitations do they have? (e.g. check the platform [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/)).
